# SQL-Projects
Description:

I created a Music Library Management System from the ground up using MySQL. This project not only helps organize and manage a large collection of music but also allows for deep data analysis to gain useful insights.

This project showcases my ability to design and implement a relational database, write complex SQL queries for data analysis, and derive meaningful insights from the data.
